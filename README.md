# Horizon or Source lines plotting tool for 21-cm cosmology experiments

pslines is a Python-based tool for generating and plotting horizon lines and source lines in the cylindrical power spectra for 21-cm cosmology analyses. The tool uses the updated horizon and source line equations derived without imposing the flat sky approximation which accurately describe the signature of the horizon and the source on the power spectrum.

# Dependencies
pslines requires some standard python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, astropy, datetime.

# Installation
pslines can be installed using pip:
```
pip install pslines
```

# Documentation
A step-by-step guide is presented in the wiki page.
