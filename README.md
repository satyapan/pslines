# Horizon or Source lines plotting tool for 21-cm cosmology experiments

pslines is a Python-based tool for generating and plotting horizon lines and source lines in the cylindrical power spectra for 21-cm cosmology analyses. The tool uses the updated horizon and source line equations derived without imposing the flat sky approximation ([Munshi et al. 2025](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2025/01/aa51181-24/aa51181-24.html)) that accurately describe the signature of the horizon and the source on the power spectrum.

# Dependencies
pslines requires some common python libraries: numpy, matplotlib, astropy.

# Installation
pslines can be installed via pip:
```
pip install pslines
```

# Documentation
A step-by-step guide is presented in the wiki page.
